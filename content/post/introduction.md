Hello and welcome to my personal website! I take the course 'Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality' this winter term at Technical University Darmstadt as part of my Master program. I am going to create a locomotion and interaction technique for AR or VR over the course of the semester and document my progress on this website.

Looking forward to it and hope you tag along :)
