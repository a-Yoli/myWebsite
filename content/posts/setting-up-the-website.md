To set up this website I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as recommended within our course.

- wanted to use different theme which needed a minimum version and explanation also minimum requirement of version

- wasnt available out of the box on Fedora, therefore I downloaded and built it myself

- worked well then but I also wanted to create categories
