    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>As previously mentioned, I have to come up and create a locomotion and interaction technique in XR over the course of this semester. When I was trying to come up with techniques, different ideas popped up in my mind, such as letting the player throw a lasso to move within the XR environment. Another idea I had, was using an animal as a metaphor for my locomotion and interaction technique. I then build up further on my different ideas. For the lasso locomotion I would need poles to throw the lasso at and then pull yourself close to. This could be done by letting the player also throw spears, which would then act as the lasso&rsquo;s poles. While I still think that this sounds like a funny idea, it also sounds kind of exhausting and I could not come up with an interaction technique, that would fit into this narrative.</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided on thinking further on my animal locomotion and interaction technique. I thought that flying could be interesting, but that locomotion technique already exists in many variations and I would prefer, if I could use the parcour we got provided at least partially. When I was thinking about animals, which move in an interesting way, I was reminded that flying squirrels exist. WHile they cannot actually fly, they do move through the air by gliding between trees using the skin between their extremities. So my locomotion technique consists of three different movements: crawling/ or climbing, where the player is able to move over ground or up a vertical surface (like a tree trunk), a jump, which pushes the player away from a surface to engage gliding and the gliding, which allows the player to move within the air.</p>

<p>With this metaphor, I instantly had an idea for an interacton technique as well: like a squirrel might hold a nut, the player holds their hands and moves them as if rotating a ball to change the orientation of an object.</p>

<p>To implement my idea, I am going to use hand tracking. Ideally I won&rsquo;t need the controllers at all. Furthermore, I will use a VR environment and not an AR environment, because I want to be able to change the virtual environment to fit my flying squirrel narrative. For this locomotion and interaction technique efficiency and simplicity plays a smaller role, my main goal is for the player to experience something new and to have fun. The locomotion and interaction are supposed to play a major role in gameplay.</p>
